# What is ChemlabAPI?
This is the brain behind chemlab.dk and all its subservices. The API is open for everyone to use for their own projects and tools, just be aware that you will be blocked if you spam the API.

# Contributing
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project. You can add new features, fix bugs, etc., you just have to be aware that it is not certain that we will approve your pull requests. We can reject without reason, which we most likely won't do, because we want to have as many functions as possible.

# Follow these rules when contributing
1. We use javascript via node js and express as api library

2. The "data" folder is for all data, including the chemistry data. (We'll probably change this later, we're not sure). You can create new folders under this if you have many json files with data, under a specific category. We always use json files for data, unless what you are doing cannot be done with json, but it still needs to be in the data folder.

3. Do not change the code structure too much. (Your pull request will be rejected if you change too much in the codebase)

4. If you can use a library that we already use for your feature, do it, don't include a new library just for your function because you don't want to use what the rest of us use.

5. Always describe your pull requests, and work on one feature at a time (we will reject your pull request if you change 1 million different things.)

6. Use your common sense!
